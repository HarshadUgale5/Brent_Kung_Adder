# Brent_Kung_Adder

This is 32-bit tree adder which performs the addition operation at faster rate as compared to Ripple Carry Adder. The file is written in Verilog along with TestBench Module included into it.

BK32-bit is designed using 2 BK16-bit adders. This ripples the carry so planning to redesign it.
